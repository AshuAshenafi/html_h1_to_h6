        <h1>People come to our Life for a REASON, for a SEASON, for <strong>LIFE TIME</strong>.</h1>
        <h2>Some People amaze me, They shake your hand and warm your heart.</h2>
        <h3>When God loves you (always loves you), He gives no money but People.</h3>
        <h4>This Universe is beautiful, very complex and at the same time very simple;</h4>
        <h5>I wonder why People say no one ever made this Universe, What a "Religion".</h5>
        <h6>God loves humer, brings two different People, call them husband and wife, and says You are ONE.</h6>
